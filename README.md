#### Game Interface
The game features a simple User Interface which displays the current objective and explains the most complex controls.  

Unlike common games, in Primal Light there was no need to show the player’s health through the UI, instead we followed the game concept and decided its health should be displayed as the brightness of the light in the character’s skin.

## Game Details

### Story

This game takes place in a world where Light is a part of all living things, it is what one might call their soul. This is many times visible in the outwards appearance of living things though light lines and stripes. For as long as something emits light into the world, it is alive.  

When Something does not emit light you can be sure it is not alive anymore.  

In this world, a new tribe is formed, this tribe is so young that they don't know of the existence of death, but they soon will...  

On a fateful day a pair of friends from this tribe are taking a stroll through the mountains, however while walking something strange starts to happen to one of the friends: its light starts flickering! Shortly after its light goes out, this is a clear sign she somehow died.  

Her friend doesn't understand what is happening, he tries to get his friend to move but fails, this tells him that something is clearly very wrong and he starts panicking, the only thing he can do is ask the village sage for help. This sage is the oldest denizen of the tribe and is said to be many decades older than anyone else in the tribe.  

The sage tells him about a long forgotten civilization that used to inhabit the world and were able to freely control the flow of light, this civilization even seemed to be able to control the cycle of life and death. After this he points him in the direction of a set of complexes where he might be able to put together an artifact that will help him bring his friend back to life, he does however warn him that this will be a tough and perilous journey.  

Without a second of hesitation he goes in search of this artifact. After a very long journey he is able to put the artifact back together and dashes off to try to help his friend.  

What happened next has been lost to history.
